make build - compiles and builds binary for all in src
make run - runs binary file

Color buffer:
an array of numbers in hexidecimal notation
nothing but an array in memory, this space in memory is a series of numbers
SDL renders all these colors/numbers as a texture

0xFFFF0000 - color renders red

we need to create a data structure that receives a lot of these colors
to encode a number like this it takes 32 bits

number of bytes to hold an int in c - depends on compiler
and machine. 

will declare uint32_t* color_buffer; - which will be a pointer to an array
in memory, the size of which will depend on the window height and width. Each
element in the array is 32 bits, and the pointer points to the first one in the array
num of elements in array = width x height

declare a null pointer to the buffer array
uint32_t* color_buffer = null
// allocate the required bytes in memory for the color buffer,
// malloc expects number of bytes (window width x height) x size of single color
and cast to uint32_t
void setup(void) {
    color_buffer = (uint32_t*) malloc(sizeof(uint32_t)) * window_width * window_height
}
//set the pixel at row 10 column 20 to the color red
color_buffer[(window_width * 10) + 20] = 0xFFFF0000;

colorbuffer vs framebuffer - some books/programmers call the buffer in memory
that holds pixel color values a framebuffer, but in this class we call it colorbuffer -
they're the same thing, a mirror in memory of the pixels that we want to see in our display.

allocating memory: 
The function malloc() expects the amount of bytes as parameter.
every time we use malloc - we are responsible to free this memory up when we're done
in this example we're putting it at the bottom of the main function before we quit the program

there is a possiblity that malloc fails to allocate memory, maybe the machine doesn't have enough free
memory, and will return a NULL pointer. Most programmers will test to see if return of Malloc is
null and only continue if allocation was successful.

we should always check for return errors, but for the sake of this course and our time we will assume that some
of these functions are successful

SDL texture
feed color buffer to SDL_Texture for rendering

Full Screen window
changing window size to fit full Screen - we use SDL to check for max resolution of monitor


Defining Header files
Header files - .h extension, contain only declarations and function prototypes (name of function and parameters, global variables, etc)
makes things in implementation files visible to other files
implementataion files - .c extension, contain the actual implementation of functions
